            <h2>What is Hands-On at Otago?</h2>
            <p> Hands-On at Otago is designed to support and show interested students what researchers do, why they do these things and to encourage talented young New Zealanders to consider further study as a step in their career pathway.</p>
            <p>We do this by bringing them to Otago, New Zealandâ€™s oldest and most attractive university.</p>
            <p>Otago University has an international reputation for excellence in scientific research and teaching.</p>

            <h2>When does Hands-On at Otago take place?</h2>
            <p>Hands-On at Otago is held at the University of Otago, Dunedin, during the secondary school summer holidays.</p>
            <p>For 2020 the opening session will be on the evening of Sunday January 12, and the programme continues daily from Monday through to Friday.</p>
            <p>It closes with a report-back showcase session on the Friday morning, finishing with lunch.</p>

            <h2>What will I do at Hands-On?</h2>
            <p>Each day at Hands-On is divided between three activities.</p>
            <h3>Research Project</h3>
            <p>Each morning students participate in a Research Project in one University department. Allocation to these projects is based on the five projects you selected at registration.</p>
            <p>For each project we also try to achieve a good balance of skills and backgrounds, while accommodating the specific requirements of individual projects and supervisors.</p>
            <p>Every attempt is made to satisfy student preferences.</p>
            <h3>Afternoon Snack Programme</h3>
            <p>The Snack programme allows students to have a small taste of a variety of other research  activities, both on and off campus, during the afternoon programme.</p>
            <p>Each afternoon Snack comprises two hours of interactive, fun opportunities for students to see researchers in action in real-life situations.</p>
            <p>We hope that these snacks will introduce participants to the exciting diversity of research and its countless practical applications.</p>
            <h3>Social Activities</h3>
            <p>The learning programme is balanced by a variety of social and recreational activities in the afternoons and evenings.</p>
            <p>Experienced supervision will be provided at all times during the course of the Hands-On at Otago programme.</p>
